# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Input
```text
Enter the number of vertices: 5
Enter the adjacency matrix (enter 0 for no direct edge between vertices):
0 10 0 30 100
10 0 50 0 0
0 50 0 20 10
30 0 20 0 60
100 0 10 60 0
Enter the source node: 4
Enter the destination node: 0
```

## Output
```text
The shortest path from node 4 to 0 is: 
4 2 3 0 
Total cost of the path: 60
```
